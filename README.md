# Snake
This program should display the game Snake exactly as it was in the cube form on the beautiful old Nokia 
and not as smoothly as in the new versions.



What it contains:

-It should contain the snail, which grows by one unit of length with each food cube (one cube). \\

-It must not be controlled against the walls, then it's game over. 

-It is also not allowed to turn 180 degrees directly, this also leads to game over (two times 90 degrees is of course 
allowed as long as the snail has moved at least one length unit further)



If that works:

Speed adjustment, the longer the snake, the faster it gets. |could be done.

Leaderboard/Highscore (TopTen) |check

break-function |has to be done

sound effects? 

At the end einen Unit-test schreiben.
